DLL Conflicts on using Release Build 
------------------------------------

MATLAB ships with its own copies of the COMPAQ fortran "Release" DLLs - this means that the "Debug" project 
will build and run OK, but the "Release" one will fail to produce a usable libisisexc.dll as it will have linked
against DLL versions more recent than MATLAB provides. To get round this problem, you just need to rename the
versions shipped with MATLAB so that it will pick up the system installed ones provided by the COMPAQ Visual
FORTRAN environment (installed in \windows\system32 or \winnt\system32) instead   

- Go into the MATLAB DLL directory (somewhere like c:\matlab6p5p1\win32\bin) 
- rename both  DFORRT.DLL  and  DFORMD.DLL  to some other names
